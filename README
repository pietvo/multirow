multirow.sty:
============

Make an entry that will span multiple rows of a table.

\multirow{nrows}[bigstruts]{width}[fixup]{text}


bigstrut.sty:
============

Creates struts which (slightly) stretch the table row in which they sit.
This is mainly used to prevent the row contents to touch the \hline's
above and/or below it.

\bigstrut or \bigstrut[t] or \bigstrut[b]

bigdelim.sty:
============

Creates an appropriately-sized delimiter (for example, brace,
parenthesis or bracket) to fit in a single multirow,
to indicate a relationship between other rows

\ldelim ( {n} {width} [text] 
\rdelim } {n} {width} [text]
